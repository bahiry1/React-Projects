# Table-Project
In this project, I'm using an api to fetch users data from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to a table.
 The table contain the following columns:
- Full Name
-Email 
-Gender
-Age

The user can sort any column , also the user can search any text on table data. 
Each time the user clicks on a row, the user can see the row data and the exact location of  the user .
This project was built on React.js using the Material-table design library.
